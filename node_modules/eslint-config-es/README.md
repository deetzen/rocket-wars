## Quick Start

This module contains a very strict ESLint configuration for ES2015 and above, both for server and client development. Its aims to eradicate *any* variation in code style. If you can not tell any more, based on little individual manners, who of your co-workers wrote a piece of code, this module succeeded. This helps you to narrow down your focus to pure functionality, as you do not have to think about code styling any more at all.

To use one of those configurations, create a `.eslintrc.json` file in your project and use the `extends` keyword.

```json
{
  "extends": "es/2015/server"
}
```

Alternatively, you may also use `es/2015/client`.

If you want to override any rules, you can do so in your configuration file.

## Running the build
