Add anchors to [**remark**][remark] heading nodes using GitHubâ€™s
algorithm.

> :warning: This is often useful when compiling to HTML.  If youâ€™re doing that,
> itâ€™s probably smarter to use [`remark-rehype`][remark-rehype] and
> [`rehype-slug`][rehype-slug] and benefit from the [**rehype**][rehype]
> ecosystem.

## Installation

[npm][]:

```bash
npm install remark-slug
```

## Usage

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
# Lorem ipsum ðŸ˜ª

## dolorâ€”sitâ€”amet

### consectetur &amp; adipisicing

#### elit

##### elit
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
var unified = require('unified')
var markdown = require('remark-parse')
var slug = require('remark-slug')
var remark2rehype = require('remark-rehype')
var html = require('rehype-stringify')

unified()
  .use(markdown)
  .use(slug)
  .use(remark2rehype)
  .use(html)
  .process(fs.readFileSync('example.md'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```html
<h1 id="lorem-ipsum-">Lorem ipsum ðŸ˜ª</h1>
<h2 id="dolorsitamet">dolorâ€”sitâ€”amet</h2>
<h3 id="consectetur--adipisicing">consectetur &#x26; adipisicing</h3>
<h4 id="elit">elit</h4>
<h5 id="elit-1">elit</h5>
```

## API

### `remark.use(slug)`

Adds slugs to markdown headings.

Uses [`github-slugger`][ghslug], which creates GitHub-style slugs.

Sets `data.id` and `data.hProperties.id` on heading nodes.
The first can be used by any plugin as a unique identifier, the second tells
[`mdast-util-to-hast`][to-hast] (used in [`remark-html`][remark-html] and
[`remark-rehype`][remark-rehype]) to use its value as an `id` attribute.
